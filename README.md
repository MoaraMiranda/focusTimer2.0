## Overview
The Pomodoro Study Timer is a simple yet effective web application built using JavaScript ES6 to help you boost your productivity by utilizing the Pomodoro Technique. This technique is a time management method that encourages focused work intervals (usually 25 minutes) followed by short breaks to enhance concentration and maintain productivity. ES6 was employed to modularize different components of the project and enhance logical reasoning skills.
